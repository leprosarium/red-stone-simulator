MC Simulator hasn't been updated in a while and this is something I am working on.  Written in C# and it uses allot of windows API's.  If someone wants to convert it, great, but don't ask me.  I am tired of learning a new API every week.

Currently I am working with a decompile of the MCReadstoneSim v2.2 and will be updating that.  Once I think it works the way I want I will slowly port it.
